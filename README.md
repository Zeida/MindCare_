# MindCare

For my final degree project, I developed a software tool that addresses the crucial role of emotional well-being in our daily lives. Understanding that our emotional state can influence our ability to think, feel, and act, this application leverages technology to promote personal well-being.

MindCare offers a variety of resources for self-care, emotional support, and social interaction, all enhanced with a unique badge system that motivates users in their personal growth journey. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for professionals in therapeutic processes, supporting the promotion of healthy habits.
